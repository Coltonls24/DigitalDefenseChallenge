select @websiteID := WEBSITE_ID from websites where URL = 'http://foo.com';
select @pageID := PAGE_ID from pages where path = '/login.html' and WEBSITE_ID = @websiteID;

select * from vulnerabilities
inner join pages on vulnerabilities.PAGE_ID = pages.PAGE_ID
where pages.WEBSITE_ID = @websiteID and pages.PAGE_ID = @pageID; 

I was using SQLFiddle to test the scripts for the data set you sent me. To make sure that the script was performant
I used a single inner join using two variaibles from seperate queries as subqueries would bog down the script 
with large data sets. If we wanted to further increas the performace of tables a solution would be to add clustered indexes
as each one could be unique. This however would require you to add a WEBSITE_ID column to the vulnerabilities table.
